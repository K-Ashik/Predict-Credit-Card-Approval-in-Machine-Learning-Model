# Project Overview

In the Predicting Credit Card Approvals project, I have built the best-performing machine learning model for predicting credit card application approvals. 

First, I have checked out the data and impute missing values. After that, I have preprocessed the data and train a logistic regression model on the training set. In the end, I have evaluated the results and improve the model performance using Grid searching.
